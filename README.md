# ML Application Project by Eleazar Neamat

This project is a Python-based application built using **Streamlit** to perform classification tasks on datasets such as **Iris** or **Tips**. It provides an interactive interface for data preprocessing, model selection, training, evaluation, and prediction.

## Features
- **Dataset Selection**: Load either the Iris or Tips dataset directly from Seaborn.
- **Preprocessing**: Handle missing values and encode categorical variables.
- **Feature and Target Selection**: Choose features and target variables via dropdown menus.
- **Data Splitting**: Use a slider to set the test size percentage for splitting data into training and testing sets.
- **Model Selection**: Select between Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier for training.
- **Model Training**: Train the model with a single button click and view performance metrics like accuracy and classification report.
- **Predictions**: Provide input data to predict outcomes using the trained model.
